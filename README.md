# Pokedex (Front-end)

Using the open pokemon API (​http://pokeapi.co/​) build a pokedex with the following functionality:

1. List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show).

2. The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50).

3. Filter the pokemons by name with a search box.

4. Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected).

The app is developed with React and ​MobX in ES6.
